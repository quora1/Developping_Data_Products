Prediction of Temperature from Ozone

This simple shiny application predicts Temperature based on Ozone concentration using linear regression model and the airquality dataset. The user is asked to pick a value of ozone concentration (in ppb) and get's the predicted temperature (in degrees F) together with a plot showing correlation between the two values together with the fitted line ( obtained by running: lm(Temp ~ Ozone, data = airquality). The files of the applications are:

-ui.R

-server.R

In order to view and use the application, open both files in RStudio and click "Run App"

Have fun!
